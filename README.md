# motifFinder

The 'motif' class allows to find a motif in a protein sequence. The search functions are based on position weight matrices. A position weight matrix (PWM), also known as position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), is a commonly used representation of motifs or patterns in biological sequences. PWMs are often derived from a set of aligned sequences that are thought to related.
